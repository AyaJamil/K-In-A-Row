How the Game Works:
When the program starts, it prompts the user to input the number of rows, columns, and the target number K, which is the count of consecutive pieces needed to win.

Gameplay:
Player Y begins by entering a column number where they’d like to place their piece, with columns numbered from 0, similar to array indexing.
Turn-Based Play: Players alternate turns, each placing their piece in their selected column until one player achieves K consecutive pieces—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Winning and Endgame:
Once a player reaches the target sequence of K, the program declares the winner and displays the total number of moves taken. Note that the maximum number of columns allowed on the board is 7
